# BIK

Bink Video is a proprietary video file format developed by RAD Game Tools, and primarily used for full-motion video sequences in video games.
The format includes its own video and audio codecs, supporting resolutions from 320Ã—240 all the way up to high definition video.

The format was reverse-engineered by the FFmpeg project and Bink decoding is supported by the open-source libavcodec library.
